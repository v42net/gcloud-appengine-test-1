# gcloud-issue-test-1
Testing an issue with app engine static files not being found. The purpose is 
either to solve the issue, or to prove it is a bug (and file a bug report).
- https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/building-app#local-machine
- https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/serving-static-files?tab=go#serving_from_your_application

Remarks while trying to exactly follow the procedure about building an app:
- Install the bundled Python version to be sure to have the correct version.
- During `gcloud init` I created a new project named `gcloud-issue-test-1`.
